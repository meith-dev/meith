# MyBB parity decisions

R4.2 closes with: *"MyBB's real resolution has twenty years of special cases.
Implement the rules above. Where an imported board diverges, record it in
`docs/mybb-parity.md` with a decision — do not guess silently."*

This file is that record. Every entry states what MyBB does, what we do, and
why. An entry is added when a divergence is **chosen**, not when one is
discovered by accident — a surprise is a bug, not a parity decision.

## flood-intervals

**MyBB** stores `searchfloodtime` (and `floodtime`) as a per-usergroup numeric
column, combined like any other numeric limit.

**We** do not model flood intervals as a permission field at all. The board
setting `search.flood_seconds` holds the interval, and the existing
`canBypassFloodCheck` boolean permission exempts a group from it.

**Why.** R4.2 mandates one combination rule for all numerics: take the maximum,
with `0` meaning unlimited and therefore beating every other value. That rule is
correct for *allowances* — attachment size, posts per day — because a larger
number is more permissive. It is exactly backwards for an *interval*, where the
most permissive value is the smallest non-zero one. A user in a 30-second group
and a 5-second group should get 5 seconds; MAX would give them 30.

Keeping the field would have required a fourth combination kind used by two
fields, and a permanent footnote on the F22 matrix. Modelling it as a setting
plus a boolean keeps R4.2 literally true for every field in the registry — the
boolean combines by OR, which gives the right answer with no special case.

**Cost.** An imported board loses per-group flood granularity: everyone is
either subject to the board interval or exempt from it. Reintroducing
granularity later means adding a `numeric-min` kind to
`packages/core/src/permissions.ts` and one row per actor to the F22 fixture.

## Permission field naming

**MyBB** uses lowercase, unpunctuated column names (`canpostthreads`,
`canviewthreads`, `cansearch`).

**We** use camelCase keys (`canPostThreads`) mapped to snake_case columns
(`can_post_threads`).

**Why.** The keys are consumed as TypeScript property names across three
packages, and `canviewothersthreads` is genuinely ambiguous to read. The mapping
is mechanical and lives in `packages/db/src/schema/permission-columns.ts`, so
importer code can translate a legacy column name in one place.

## Separate `canAccessAdminCp` and `isAdministrator`

**MyBB** treats admin status and admin CP access as effectively the same thing
(`cp_access` gates panel modules for an already-admin user).

**We** keep them as two fields: `isAdministrator` grants the permission bypass,
`canAccessAdminCp` grants the panel.

**Why.** R4.2 requires the bypass be explicit and logged. Splitting the fields
makes it possible to grant a trusted role read access to the panel without also
handing it the ability to bypass every forum permission on the board — and makes
the audit log meaningful, because a bypass entry now implies a specific field.
